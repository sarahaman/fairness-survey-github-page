                     between women and men, we will make sure to select 10 women and 10 men. In this scenario, we might

             In other words, patients who need to be seen have a lower chance of being selected simply by being women. <br> <br>

             of the men. Similarly, of the patients who do not need to be seen today, we will select 2 / 8 = 25% of the women, and
